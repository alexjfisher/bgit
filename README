ABOUT

This plugin provides Git support to the excellent Atlassian Bamboo continous
integration server.

It is compatible with Bamboo 2.1.x but it may work with older 2.x versions.


INSTALLATION

   1. Copy to $BAMBOO_INSTALL_DIR/webapp/WEB-INF/lib
   2. Restart Bamboo

Now when you create or edit plans you will be able to select “Git” as the
repository provider.

Right now the plugin is very rough and has very few options but it works.

All the groundwork was done by Don Brown from Atlassian. Until Atlassian can
provide resources to the plugin I will be mantaining it here on github.
